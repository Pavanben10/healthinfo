<p><em><strong>How we see the world shapes who we choose to be — and sharing compelling experiences can frame the way we treat each other, for the better. This is a powerful perspective.</strong></em></p>

<p>By now, body positivity is inarguably mainstream. Most people have heard some iteration of it or have seen the hashtag on social media. On the surface, you might believe that it’s about self-love and body acceptance. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/body-positivity-origins">this current interpretation has limits</a>&nbsp;— limits against body size, shape, color, and many other aspects of a person’s identity — and these limits exist because #bodypositivity has largely forgotten its political roots from fat acceptance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fat acceptance, which started in the 1960s as National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, has been around through different waves and forms for about 50 years. Currently, fat acceptance is a&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5893.2008.00346.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social justice movement aiming to make body culture more inclusive and diverse, in all its forms</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And here’s the truth: Body positivity first helped me want to change the way I viewed my body. It gave me hope that it would be OK to do that. It wasn’t until I noticed that #bodypositivity influencers made me feel inadequate, like my body was too much to be really OK, that I started to question whether or not I belonged there.</p>

<h2><a>To be seen, you have to be society’s idea of a ‘good fatty’</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Searching #bodypositivity or #bopo on social media shows where the two movements differ. The hashtags yield mostly pictures of women, mostly women in the more privileged body types: thin, white, and cis. Although a bigger body will occasionally trend, these examples don’t populate search results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This act of centering a privileged body, one that might look like your own or a #bopo influencer’s, isn’t inherently problematic, but framing a privileged body decenters fat people and actual marginalized bodies even further from the conversation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone can have negative experiences or emotions around their body, but it isn’t the same as the systemic discrimination fat bodies face. The feeling of being constantly left out or judged for your body size isn’t the same as not loving your skin or feeling comfortable in your body. They’re both valid, just not the same because the automatic respect society gives thin bodies doesn’t exist for fat people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And discrimination gets stronger as the body gets fatter.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Despite the fact that body size or appearance not being good measures of health, society holds higher expectations for fat people to be a “good fatty”.</p></blockquote>

<h3>As a fat dietitian, people are less likely to take me seriously than a thinner dietitian</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My abilities and knowledge are in question, both implicitly and explicitly because of my body size. Clients and other professionals alike have questioned my ability to provide care and have decided not to work with me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when fat bodies like mine are shown positively, there’s often backlash from followers or trolls — people who follow hashtags and attempt to discredit things that show up under them. It’s vulnerable to post pictures of your body if it’s fat. To talk about how being healthy at any size is possible is emotionally exhausting. The bigger your body, the more marginalized you are, and the more you risk being harassed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some fat influencers will feel pressured to prove their health by talking about their blood test results, showing themselves eating a salad, or talking about their exercise routine in order to preemptively respond to questions of “but health?” In other words, despite&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-10-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">body size or appearance not being good measures of health</a>, society holds higher expectations for fat people to be a “good fatty.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the keyboard health police and their unsolicited advice hurt both thin and fat people, their&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-015-0153-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments will incite a different kind of shame and stigma for fat people</a>. Thin people get more of a pass on health comments, while fat people are often diagnosed on pictures alone, assumed to have a variety of health conditions. This translates off-screen and into the doctor’s office, too:&nbsp;<a href="https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/everything-you-know-about-obesity-is-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fat people are told to lose weight for just about any health concern</a>, whereas thin people are more likely to receive medical care.</p>

<h3>Another aspect of ‘being fat in the right way’ is to have a relentless positive personality</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Body positive influencers often tend to talk about loving their body, being happy in their body, or feeling “sexy” for the first time. These are wonderful things, and it’s amazing to feel that in a body that you hated for a long time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, turning this positivity into a dominant feature or requirement of the movement adds another impossible standard to live up to. Very few people actually experience constant and unwavering self-love, and even fewer people in marginalized bodies experience this on a regular basis. A person actively doing the work to change their beliefs about their own body is doing amazing and healing work, but in a world that fosters a fatphobic culture, this journey can feel lonely.</p>
