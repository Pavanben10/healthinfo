<p>Your mind is central to your identity. The sharpness of your thinking, your ability to communicate and connect with others, and the rich trove of memories you’ve collected over a lifetime all have enormous value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you get older, you may notice changes in some of your thinking skills, including cognitive decline. Cognitive decline is the gradual loss of thinking abilities such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>learning</li><li>remembering</li><li>paying attention</li><li>reasoning</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/how-aging-brain-affects-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some peopleTrusted Source</a>, a small amount of cognitive decline occurs with age. But more significant changes can be a sign of a cognitive disorder. Injury, illness, and health habits can influence how much and how fast your cognitive abilities change over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This article explores how your cognitive abilities can change later in life. It also provides some practical guidance to help you keep your brain healthy as you age.</p>

<h3>Stages of cognitive decline</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Specialists generally recognize four stages of cognition as people age:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>No cognitive impairment (NCI):</strong>&nbsp;You don’t experience any differences in your thinking ability or in the complex skills that make up cognition.</li><li><strong>Subjective cognitive decline (SCD):</strong>&nbsp;You notice that some of your thinking abilities have begun to decline but not enough to interfere with how you function day to day.</li><li><strong>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI):</strong>&nbsp;You experience a decline in your ability to reason, remember, use language, make judgments, and perceive the world around you accurately.</li><li><strong>Dementia:</strong>&nbsp;You have trouble with activities of daily living. These include driving, paying bills, taking care of your living space, and caring for your body and your health.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCI and SCD are typical as you get older. MCI and dementia are cognitive disorders with symptoms that can occur along a spectrum of severity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What are the signs of cognitive decline?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cognitive decline looks different from person to person. That may be because people vary in their health profiles, life circumstances, and capabilities. Still, some patterns have emerged from the research.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People with mild cognitive decline might:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>have trouble finding the right words to express themselves, especially when compared with others of the same age</li><li>lose or misplace things</li><li>forget appointments and scheduled events</li><li>become overwhelmed by complex tasks and projects</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep in mind that typical forgetfulness is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7248257/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not the sameTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;as cognitive decline. It’s not helpful to assume that regular forgetfulness is necessarily a sign of cognitive decline. Such worrying can affect your well-being.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you notice any of these signs, it may be time to visit a healthcare professional:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>You get lost in once-familiar areas.</li><li>You become frustrated with communication difficulties.</li><li>You experience mood or personality changes, such as more anxiety or aggression.</li><li>You ask the same questions over and over.</li><li>You have trouble recognizing friends and family members.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>How do doctors detect cognitive decline?&nbsp;</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A doctor can help you determine whether you’re experiencing typical signs of aging or symptoms of cognitive decline. They may assign you a brief self-screening test to check for symptoms of cognitive decline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE) and other screening tests</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several screen tests that you can use to check for signs of cognitive decline. These tests usually take about 3 to 15 minutes. They include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE)</li><li>AD8 Dementia Screening Interview</li><li>Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS)</li><li>Mini-Cog</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/early-signs-of-dementia-may-be-noticeable-in-at-home-written-test">SAGE</a>&nbsp;is one of the most common screening tests. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/brain-spine-neuro/memory-disorders/sage/download-the-sage-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download the test online</a>&nbsp;and complete it at home. You can also take it to a doctor’s office to complete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SAGE differs from the other tests in that it is slightly more complex. A&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35348521/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 studyTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;found that SAGE detected cognitive decline in people with MCI 6 months sooner than MMSE, another common test. According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8650250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 reviewTrusted Source</a>, SAGE produces a correct result 79% of the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note that these quick tests are not enough to diagnose cognitive decline or dementia on their own. If your score shows some decline, it may be a sign for a doctor to do a more thorough evaluation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Neuropsychological tests</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an evaluation, doctors often use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heres-how-cognitive-tests-work-and-what-they-look-for">neuropsychological tests</a>&nbsp;to see whether your thinking and memory skills are changing. Some of the most common tests are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</li><li>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</li><li>Sahlgrenska Academy Self-Reposed Cognitive Impairment Questionnaire (SASCI-Q)</li><li>Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q)</li><li>Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MCQ)</li><li>Everyday Cognition (ECog)</li><li>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale</li><li>6-Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT)</li><li>Hong Kong Brief Cognitive Test (HKBC)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of these tests are relatively new. More research is needed to understand how well they predict or measure cognitive decline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Other tests</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A doctor might order a blood test to see if something else — like hypothyroidism or a B12 deficiency — may be causing a change in your thinking abilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brain imaging, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/head-mri">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</a>, may help a doctor determine whether something like a stroke or brain tumor is at the root of your symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Experimental tests</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers are also looking into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101073/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood or spinal fluid testsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;that look for proteins linked to Alzheimer’s disease. These proteins are called beta-amyloid and tau.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In studies,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7248257/#s6title" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain imagingTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;like MRI and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pet-scan">PET scans</a>&nbsp;can show changes in some parts of the brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The above tests may be able to detect changes in your brain up to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/new-blood-test-method-may-predict-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 yearsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;before symptoms appear. But they’re often too costly, invasive, or complex to use for screening purposes. There’s ongoing research into simpler and more cost-effective screening tests.</p>

<h2><a>What causes cognitive decline?&nbsp;</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many reasons you may experience age-related changes in thinking and memory. Sometimes, another health condition may be the cause. Examples include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>high blood pressure</li><li>vascular (blood vessel) disease</li><li>depression</li><li>sleep deprivation</li><li>diabetes</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, a neurological condition such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/difference-dementia-alzheimers">Alzheimer’s Disease</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/frontotemporal-dementia">frontotemporal dementia</a>&nbsp;is the underlying cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your genes and family history also play a role in whether you will experience cognitive decline as you get older. Genes may be responsible for up to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/gene-connection-age-related-cognitive-decline-confirmed-mouse-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">60% to 70%Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;of the various ways cognition declines due to aging.</p>
